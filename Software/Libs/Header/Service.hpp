/**
 * @class Service
 * @brief Background half of the app: the clock and one sensor.
 *
 * The leanest of the four faces. It draws no charge level, no active minutes
 * and no heart rate, so it subscribes to none of them -- which for heart rate
 * matters beyond tidiness, since that subscription is what keeps the optical
 * sensor running.
 *
 * The clock is read once a turn round the loop, which is both what gets
 * published and what sizes the wait; the step sensor is event driven, so
 * apart from its events the thread is blocked.
 *
 * The clock format and the date order are the two things here that are neither
 * a clock reading nor a sensor event: they are pulled from the kernel's system
 * settings, which push nothing when they change. See
 * @ref refreshSystemSettings.

     * GUI starting, the GUI asking after a resume, and the loop's own poll.
     * The poll is bounded to once a minute and is what catches a change made
     * while the face is on screen, which no event announces and neither
     * lifecycle edge can see. The kernel re-reads settings.json when the phone
     * finishes writing it over BLE, and local_settings.json -- which is where

     * it, and a full queue rejects the newest message outright. A publish that
     * failed that way is retried -- the flag records the send's result -- but
     * only when its source next speaks, and a charge level or a step count can
     * be quiet for many minutes. Clearing the flags here forces the current
